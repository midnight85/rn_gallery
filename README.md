## A simple React Native gallery application with two screens was developed using the Unsplash API.
- The application utilizes Redux Toolkit for state management and storage.
- Queries to the API are made using axios and Redux Thunk middleware.
- The main screen of the application displays a grid of images along with their descriptions and authors, implementing infinite scroll functionality for seamless browsing.
- Users can swipe from top to bottom to fetch images from random pages.
- When an image is clicked, a new screen opens, presenting the selected image in full-screen mode.
- In case of any errors during API communication, alerts are used to provide error feedback to the user.
